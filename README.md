# Twitter VirtualScroller

This project is a demo of the VirtualScroller component on Twitter, which allows for efficient rendering of large data sets in web applications. For more information on the VirtualScroller component, please refer to the article "[Twitter Lite and High Performance React Progressive Web Apps at Scale](https://medium.com/@paularmstrong/twitter-lite-and-high-performance-react-progressive-web-apps-at-scale-d28a00e780a3)".

The VirtualScroller source code used in this project was obtained through reverse engineering the JavaScript code on twitter.com. With the help of ChatGPT, the obfuscated JavaScript code was deobfuscated and made readable. The result was manually debugged and optimized.
